From the analysis done on jupter notebook, I was able to make the following primary findings:

Artist Dominance - Post Malone and XXXTentacion appear most frequently in the top tracks.
Popular songs tend to have high danceability and moderate energy.
Top tracks cluster around 90–110 BPM, suggesting this tempo range resonates most.
Most hit songs are under 4 minutes, aligning with modern streaming preferences.
Energy, loudness, and danceability are moderately correlated with variance.

This project was quite interesting to me as I stream music regularly on spotify and the findings seem to support some of my personal observations of music in recent years.
